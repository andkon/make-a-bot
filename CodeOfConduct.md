# Make-a-bot Code of Conduct

Be friendly and welcoming
Be patient
Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
Be thoughtful
Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
Be respectful
In particular, respect differences of opinion. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
Avoid destructive behavior
Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer (or at least solicit) suggestions as to how things may be improved.
Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments).

The following actions are explicitly forbidden:

* Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
* Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
* Bullying or systematic harassment.
* Unwelcome sexual advances.
* Incitement to any of these.
